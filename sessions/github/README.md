# Instructions

Please make sure you have covered all of the following steps *before* the session date. We will not spend time on these steps during the session and some of them are essential for it.

-  **gitHub account.** You will nee a [gitHub](https://github.com/) account. Note that if you get some cool [benefits](https://education.github.com/benefits) if you are a student or a teacher.

- **Git.** Before starting this session make sure you have `git` installed on your computer. The [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) web page has a very straightforward way to install it. You can also look at this [gitHub tuttorial](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) that includes a way to install it from the [gitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/).

- **gitHub desktop.** It is not mandatory to have gitHub desktop but some people prefer to use it. You can do everything in R-Studio and github.com. In this session we will cover both the R-Studio/github.com bundle as well as the gitHub app. You can download the app [here](https://desktop.github.com/)

- **R-studio.** It is always good to have an updated version of R and R-Studio. This session works fine with `R version 4.0.4 (2021-02-15) -- "Lost Library Book"` and the R-studio version `‘1.4.1106’ "Tiger Daylily"`
